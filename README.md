Sample page made from bootstrap for CS52

Reflection:
 When do you think you might be able to use Bootstrap in the future? When would you not want to?
 I definitely will use Bootstrap in the future. I appreciate the power of css, however, as someone who just wants to make a beautiful product without thinking about complicated interaction between various stylings, this framework is perfect. I will probably use this when working on future assignments and maybe in a career setting. I perhaps would not use this on a personal product as I would want to make it truly unique and not conform to the standards set by the framwork. 
 
 What are some issues/downsides you could run into by using Bootstrap in industry?
 - Many websites end up looking the same
 - Much of the code will be unused and will slow down the product
 - Design might not match what bootstrap is capable of doing
